Laboratory Notebook and Execution Environment for Coupled Atmospheric and Land-Surface Simulations
===================================================================================================

This repository provides a lab notebook and execution environment for running coupled atmospheric and land-surface simulations using the Energy Research and Forecasting (ERF) model and the Noah-MP land surface model. ERF (https://erf.readthedocs.io) is a performance-portable atmospheric solver built on the AMReX framework (https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex) for compressible and anelastic flow simulations across CPU and GPU architectures. Noah-MP (https://ral.ucar.edu/model/noah-multiparameterization-land-surface-model-noah-mp-lsm) is a community land-surface model that simulates soil moisture, vegetation, snowpack, and runoff processes with multiple physics options. The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the configuration, compilation, and execution of ERF coupled with Noah-MP to study land–atmosphere interactions such as surface flux exchanges, boundary-layer evolution, and hydrological feedbacks. It provides reproducible workflows for setting up model builds, managing simulations, and analyzing results using Jobrunner (https://github.com/Lab-Notebooks/Jobrunner) for organization. The repository structure follows a standardized layout with ``software/`` for dependencies (AMReX, ERF, Noah-MP, NetCDF, HDF5), ``simulation/`` for case configurations (e.g., Tall Towers), and ``analysis/`` for data visualization and statistical analysis. Users can customize environment settings via ``environment.sh`` and site-specific configurations under ``sites/`` before building and running coupled cases using Jobrunner commands such as ``jobrunner setup`` and ``jobrunner submit``. This framework serves as a starting point for reproducible high-performance atmospheric–land coupling experiments and research in Earth system modeling.
